```I’ve never been a lover of existing code. Code by itself almost rots and it’s gotta be rewritten. Even when nothing has changed, for some reason it rots.```

```Computer languages of the future will be more concerned with goals and less with procedures specified by the programmer.```

```Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages, belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?```

```It was a turning point in my programming career when I realized that I didn't have to win every argument.```

```Very good professional programmers are ten times as productive as poor ones, at same training and two-year experience level.```

```Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.```

```There's no finish line```

```Programming is at least as difficult as developing a mathematical theory.```

```Any unwillingness to learn mathematics today can greatly restrict your possibilities tomorrow.```

```It was a turning point in my programming career when I realized that I didn't have to win every argument.```

```Often designers do complicated things that improve the capacity on a particular hardware platform when it might actually be cheaper to buy more hardware.```

```If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.```

```Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.```

```Flaws in computer programs are usually called bugs. It makes programmers feel good to imagine them as little things that just happen to crawl into our work. In reality, of course, we put them there ourselves.```

```Testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.```

```I’ve never been a lover of existing code. Code by itself almost rots and it’s gotta be rewritten. Even when nothing has changed, for some reason it rots.```

```Computer languages of the future will be more concerned with goals and less with procedures specified by the programmer.```

```Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages, belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?```

```Very good professional programmers are ten times as productive as poor ones, at same training and two-year experience level.```

```Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.```

``` If you cannot explain a program to yourself, the chance of the computer getting it right is pretty small.```

```Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs.```

```A language that doesn’t have everything is actually easier to program in than some that do.```

```If you learn how to solve problems, you can go through life and do pretty well```

```Every now and then I feel a temptation to design a programming language but then I just lie down until it goes away.```

```A computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.```

```The best way to predict the future is to invent it.```

```Computers are the most complex objects we human beings have ever created, but in a fundamental sense they are remarkably simple.```

```For most software, efficiency just does not matter.```

```Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.```

```Programming can be addictive```

```For most software, Efficiency just don't matter```

```When in doubt, just leave it out```

```When you stop learning, you start dying```

```From an artistic standpoint, the best software comes from the realm of intuition.```

```JavaScript is the world's most ununderstood language```

```In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.```

```We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.```

```There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX. We don't believe this to be a coincidence.```

```Life is too short to run proprietary software.```

```A small business is an amazing way to serve and leave an impact on the world you live in.```

```What you can do today can improve all your tomorrows.```

```Good people with a good process will outperform good people with no process every time.```

```My rule of thumb is 1/3 of the schedule for design, 1/6 for coding, 1/4 for component testing, and 1/4 for system testing.```

```Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing.```

```Just because you've implemented something doesn't mean you understand it```
